## Who We Are
> Bon Aqua Computer Club is owned & operated by [Andrew Grathwohl](https://grathwohl.me).

I moved to Bon Aqua from Brooklyn, NY, where I spent most of my childhood and
adult years until the COVID-19 lockdowns began taking place. It became clear to
me that this was not a disaster that we were going to protest like we did the
Iraq War, like the Stonewall Riots, and like the Union Square direct action in
the early 20th century.

After many years of believing in the things that make Tennessee great - a
respect for others' natural rights, an inherently limited centralized state
authority that works in service of people's liberties, etc., - I finally decided
to seek it out, and I am so happy I did.
